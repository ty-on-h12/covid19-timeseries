# Project overview
Some time ago I've found <a href='https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc'><b>this</b></a> API, 
it's structure is perfect for some JavaScript web app, but with <a href='https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/'><i>requests</i></a> and <a href='https://pandas.pydata.org/'><i>pandas</i></a> I scraped it and I've put it into DataFrames, so this data can be easily manipulated and modeled. EDA SECTION. MODELING SECTION. DEPLOYMENT SECTION.
